Currently cg_2d.py minmizes wrt m(x) using analytical grad and hess.

owl_2d.py is an in-progress attempt to use l1-norm + L-BFGS (OWL-QN)

test_newton_comp.py is the my attempt to minmize wrt M(k), the fourier coeffs of m(x)

creat_testsuite.py just creates some mock data to play around with.

testgrad.py was code I was using to test my gradients
